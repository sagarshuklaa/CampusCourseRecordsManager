# CampusCourseRecordsManager (CCRM)

## Project Overview
Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a console-based Java application designed to efficiently manage students, courses, enrollment, and academic records in an educational institution. It demonstrates advanced use of core Java features and object-oriented programming principles, providing a professional and extensible solution for campus administrative tasks.

## Key Features
- Add, list, update, and search student records.
- Manage course details including prerequisites and credit limits.
- Enroll students in courses and record grades.
- Generate academic transcripts automatically.
- Import and export data using CSV files.
- Create timestamped backups and restore data safely.
- Implements design patterns such as Singleton, Builder, and custom exceptions.
- Uses modern Java SE 21 capabilities, including the java.time API and NIO.2.

## Implementation Approach
- Object-Oriented Design: Core entities like Person, Student, and Instructor are represented by abstract and inherited classes, showcasing polymorphism and encapsulation.
- Design Patterns: Singleton pattern for configuration management and Builder pattern for flexible course creation.
- Robust File Handling: Uses Java NIO.2 for non-blocking file operations and safe data handling during imports, exports, and backups.
- Enumerations and Date API: Grades are handled with enums for clarity, and timestamps use the LocalDate API for accuracy.
- Exception Handling: Custom exceptions ensure graceful error recovery and better debugging.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher installed.
- Eclipse IDE (recommended) or any Java IDE that supports Java SE 21.

### Running the Application
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Eclipse and import the project:
   - Select **File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace**.
   - Browse to the cloned/downloaded project location.
   - Finish the import process.
3. Set the Java JRE System Library to JavaSE-21:
   - Right-click the project â†’ **Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries**.
   - Remove the existing JRE and add JavaSE-21.
4. Navigate to `edu.ccrm.cli.Main.java`.
5. Run `Main.java` as a Java Application.

## Usage
- Follow the interactive console prompts to add students, courses, enrollments, and grades.
- Use the import/export feature to handle bulk data operations via CSV files.
- Backups are stored with timestamps for easy data recovery.

## Additional Notes
- Refer to the `USAGE.md` file for detailed commands and examples.
- Ensure data integrity by regularly backing up using the integrated feature.
